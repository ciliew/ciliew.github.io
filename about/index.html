	<h1>About Me/h1>
	<p>I am in my final year of my PhD in _Statistics under Stochastic Metrics_ under the supervision of [Professor Søren Hauberg](http://www2.compute.dtu.dk/~sohau/).
	Before starting my PhD, I worked at Novo Nordisk A/S first as a Statistical Programmer, then as a Statistician and finally as Senior Statistician. I received both my master’s and bachelor’s in physics from the University of Copenhagen. I had a specific focus on statistical physics including dynamical systems, chaos, and stochastic systems.
